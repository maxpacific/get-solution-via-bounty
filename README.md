# get-solution-via-bounty
i'd like a website that people post problems and bounties so that others provide solutions to make money. I knew there are plenty website out there. No one succeed. Most of these websites either become garbage or scammer infested platforms, which reflects humanity. 
hi, my name is Max, i am no programmer, i tried to be and wish i could be. Before everyone can program with AI's help as nVidia CEO predicted 2 weeks ago, i have to share this idea, which is to build a site to put up bounty to get your problem solved by words, pictures, videos. i knew it is not a new idea, Many people have tried, many websites have been built. no one succeed. By succeed, i refer to people all over the world use it like google. Most of these websites either become garbage or scammer infested platforms, which reflects humanity. Dark sige humanity aside, there is bright side, people help each other. If you are encountering a problem, you let other people know, shout out loudly or publicize your problem on internet, so someone may help you for money or free of charge.Two months ago, i stumbled upon an Indian website. I was impressed, it is doing it. That Indian website could be the one. But the website is not famous and i don't recall its name. Probably what the Indian website need is capital to publicizing. Anyhow there is no world famous website now. why we need people's help rather than google solutions on ourselves? because google hits are generic, sometimes they don't fit help seekers' specific demand. it doesn't matter the website is open sourced or commercialized, the point is we need one to help each other and there is no one yet. Not that i know of. No one as popular as google that common people know of. how to build the website, structure, features, etc is step two. Step one is to get programmers' attention, that is why i post here. i knew github can do the job but i don't know how it works.My intention is to pull the old idea off. We can id some good existing websites and spread them around everybody. "we gonna ratchet it up, our species, is to take the best and to spread around everybody, so everybody grow up with better things, and start to understand the subtleties of these better things." i'd like some comments.
i would like to see it pan out.
below are my thought
